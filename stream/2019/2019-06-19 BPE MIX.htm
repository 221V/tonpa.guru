        <h3>ELIXIR BPE MIX</h3>

        <p>As was planned <a href="https://tonpa.guru/stream/2019/2019-04-11%20Новая%20версия%20BPE.htm">some time ago</a>
           BPE get KVX support in 4.6 along with Elixir bindings and upcoming BUD application
           that in addition to CHAT and SAMPLE will incorporate basic distributed BPE process.
           BANK is also BPE based application but (unlike BUD) its core process is not distributed and has
           the scope of the single user.</p>

        <p>Packaging is also changed, admin pages as a sample moved to BUD and BANK applications.
           In that way we were able to lower the size of BPE from 900 to 400 LOC.</p>
