## preprocess

Make word wrap and remove trailing spaces (MacOS).

```bash
$ for i in *; do fold -s -w 80 $i > 1; mv 1 $i; done
$ sed -i '' -E 's/[ '$'\t'']+$//' *
```

## read

As article names in cyrillic we need urlencode: https://gist.github.com/cdown/1163649

```bash
$ curl -vs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/`urlencode \
  "5HT/maxim.livejournal.com/master/articles/2012/2012-05-28 Erlang.txt"` 2>&1 | less
```
